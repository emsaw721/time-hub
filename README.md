## Description
<a href="https://emsaw721.github.io/time-hub/"> Time Hub </a> is an application that allows the user to outline their daily tasks in an easy to read format. 

## Usage
Time Hub consists of editable time blocks from 9am to 5pm where the user can write and save their tasks for the workday. 

At first, the application user will see the opening page.

Then, the user will click the red "Generate Password" button. 
This will propt the app to ask how many characters the user wants their password to contain.

## Roadmap
Future iterations of this app will provide more special characters, prompts displayed in the website box instead of a popup, as well as some minor aesthetic changes.
